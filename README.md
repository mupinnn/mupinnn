### Ahmad Muwaffaq

Hi! you can call me 'Faqih' if calling with my full name too complicated, XD. I'm Front-End Developer with React as my main weapon, SCSS and Tailwind as superb attachment to my main weapon :D.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Gulp, Webpack, and Gatsby!
- ðŸ•¸ You can visit my website at <a href="https://mupinnn.github.io/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">my github pages.</a>
- ðŸŽ“ I'm pursuing my degree at Computer Science. I hope I'll accepted in my favorite college next year (2021)!

***Cheers!***
