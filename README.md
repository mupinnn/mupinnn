# Yo! 🙋‍♂️

> Y'all can call me 'Faqih' if calling with my full name it's too complicated.

Currently work as freelance front-end web developer.

Things I do in spare time:

-   Exploring front-end kingdom.
-   Deep dive to computer science fundamental.
-   Static typing drill with TypeScript 😬.

Talk about work, I'm mostly use and comfortable with React ecosystem alongside pure CSS on top of Sass; sometimes Tailwind helped me a lot for fast prototyping. Interested in building beautiful and performant user interfaces that are also scalable.

I'm always curious and love to learn something new, even with topic that out of software engineering.
